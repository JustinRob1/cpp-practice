# C++ Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of C++ coding exercises, and small-scale projects completed for practice. It is designed to showcase problem-solving skills, understanding of core computer science concepts, and proficiency in C++ programming. The repository is organized into two main sections: **exercises** and **projects**, each containing multiple subdirectories with individual problems or assignments.

## Contents

- **exercises/**  
  Contains a variety of algorithmic and data structure problems, each in its own folder. Every exercise typically includes:
  - A problem description (`README.md`)
  - Solution code (usually in C++ and/or shell scripts)
  - Test cases and scripts for automated testing
  - Supporting files such as Makefiles and setup scripts

- **projects/**  
  Features larger assignments and mini-projects that demonstrate the application of C++ to real-world problems. Each project includes:
  - A detailed problem statement and assumptions
  - Complete solution code, often with modular design (header/source files)
  - Test suites and automation scripts
  - Documentation and usage instructions

## Topics Covered

- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, graphs, matrices)
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, shortest path, connectivity)
- File and input/output processing
- Simulation of real-world systems (reference management, navigation, makefile dependencies)
- Problem-solving techniques and algorithmic thinking

## How to Use

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` with problem-specific instructions, build steps, and example usage. Most solutions can be compiled using the provided Makefiles or standard `g++` commands. Test cases and automation scripts are included to facilitate validation and experimentation.
