# Missing Multipliers

## Summary

Given an array of integers and a parameter `m`, the program computes, for each position in the array, the product of all elements that are more than `m` positions away from that index. If there are no such elements, the output is 0 for that position.

## Problem Description

- Input:
  - The first line contains two integers, `n` (the length of the array) and `m`.
  - The next line contains `n` integers, representing the array.
- Output:
  - A single line with `n` integers, where the `i`-th integer is the product of all elements more than `m` positions away from index `i`. If there are no such elements, output 0 for that position.

## Assumptions

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
- 0 ≤ m < n
- Array elements are integers.
- Input is well-formed and follows the specified format.

## How to Run

1. Compile the program using g++:
   ```
   g++ missing_multipliers.cpp -o missing_multipliers -std=c++11 -Wall -g
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./missing_multipliers
   ```

3. Provide input as specified in the problem description.

## Example

**Input:**
```
5 1
2 3 4 5 6
```

**Output:**
```
0 12 36 24 0
```
